#summary Specification for TWX BBS
#labels Phase-Design

= Introduction =

In order to make TradeWars more approachable, the game should be made accessible via the web in a more controller manner where everyone has access to the same scripts and user interface.  The TWX BBS project is for a slimmed down TradeWars helper that uses TWX Proxy on the server-side for data collection and script execution.  The main interface for TWX BBS will be a series of web pages.
