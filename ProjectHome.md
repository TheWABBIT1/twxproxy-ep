TWX Proxy is a Trade Wars 2002 helper program designed to assist experienced players of the game in their 'art'. Unlike most other helpers, the idea of this program is to simply provide a sidelined assistance in the game rather than directing its play.   This project also includes several subprojects that look to take the same proxy design to the server-side.  The first such subproject, TWX BBS, provides a server-side proxy for sysops to script unique games for their players.

## History ##
TWX Proxy started life as a commercial product by Xide, but was later released as Open Source under the GPL2 license in 2005.  Development has resumed in this branch of the TWX Proxy project.  Originally, there were several forks of TWX Proxy, however, at this time, this branch, known as ElderProphet's version, is the only actively developed project.

## Goals ##
This project aims to produce:
  1. A client-side helper for traditional TradeWars players
  1. A set of server and client-side tools to provide a better environment for casual gamers

Since we are building on the stable TWX Proxy, the helper is stable and ready for use.  The second goal is one that is in the early design and implementation phases.
