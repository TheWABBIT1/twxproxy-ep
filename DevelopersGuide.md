# Setting up your development environment #

TWX Proxy currently consists of two applications: the Delphi-based proxy and an experimental Java client.  To check out our code, follow the instructions on [this page](http://code.google.com/p/twxproxy-ep/source/checkout)

## TWX Proxy server ##

You will need to install Turbo Delphi in order to develop the TWX Proxy server.  The free [Delphi Explorer](http://tx.codegear.com/delphiTurbo) works fine, but its installation can be a pain.  Alternatively, there is this nice portable version that is much easier to install:

## TWX Proxy JClient ##

If you want to hack on the experimental Java client, you will need [Apache Ant](http://ant.apache.org) installed to compile and build the client jar.
